// Architecture dependent macros for atomic operations

/* 
 * There is a notable difference between __x86__ and __ARM_CM4__
 * implementations. ARM macros implement the atomic operations using the
 * Load-link/store-conditional instructions and x86 uses the compare-exchange.
 *
 * Then, the ARM implementation is too restrictive. It ensures that any
 * inter-living is detected from any source e.g. interrupts and shared memory
 * among cores. The x86 implementation is too relaxed and suffers from the ABA
 * problem since the thread B can change the value to the expected one by the
 * thread A that begun the atomic operation.

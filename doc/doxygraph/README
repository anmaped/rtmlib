About

This is doxygraph, a Perl script that will generate a diagram in Graphviz dot
format, using as input the XML based format generated by Doxygen. Doxygraph is
part of doxygraph, a free system for reverse engineering UML class diagrams from
source code, and presenting those diagrams as interactive web apps.

Dependencies
============

The following CPAN modules are required:

    File::Spec
    GraphViz2
    Hash::FieldHash
    lib::abs
    Moose
    namespace::autoclean
    XML::Rabbit

Usage
=====

The doxygraph Perl script can be used without needing to install it, although a
Makefile is provided for optional installation.

The script expects two commandline arguments: the first is the name of the input
file (usually index.xml generated by Doxygen) and the second is the name of the
output file.

To instruct Doxygen to generate XML output, set the option GENERATE_XML = YES
in your Doxyfile.

Installation
============

If you want to install doxygraph, follow the usual procedure for installing Perl
modules:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

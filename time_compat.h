 * We may interpret timestamps as uint8_t, uint16_t, uint24_t, uint32_t, and
 * uint64_t.
 *
 *  - uint8_t only contains 255 ticks and is small; It means that we have to
 *  execute the monitors as fast as 255 ticks, inducing a huge overhead.
 *
 *  - uint16_t can be enough for faster monitors (the Cortex-M is excluded)
 *
 *  - uint24_t is enough if the monitor has a period no bigger than 100hz
 *
 *  - uint32_t is enough if the monitor has a period no bigger than 1hz
 *
 *  - for all the other cases uint64_t is required
 *
 * In this note, the timestamps are measured in nanoseconds.
